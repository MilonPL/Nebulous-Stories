﻿[color=#ffff00]Mission Statement:

Nebulous Stories exists to foster high quality roleplay in all capacities. Here, players may create characters that engage in collaborative roleplay and do cool things. These characters have few rules binding their freedom, bar that they do engage in quality roleplay. We support a community of players who share similar desires: to tell good stories over achieve mechanical wins. Above all else, we hold that respect is key. Due to the nature of HRP and this server, players are given the freedom to discuss mature and potentially sensitive topics. If you are uncomfortable with such content, we recommend that you do not play.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]By connecting to Nebulous Stories you confirm you are 18 years old or older. If you are suspected of being under 18 you will be permanently removed.[/color]

The use of 3rd party applications to modify the game, or to attack server infrastructure, will be met with an appeal-only ban.

[color=#a4885c]1.0 Zero Tolerance Policies:[/color]
Policies and rules that we provide no or extremely low amounts of leeway and tolerance for.

[color=#a4885c]1.1[/color] Admins reserve the right to disregard any and all rules should they deem it to be in the interest of the current round, server, or community.
- Not all examples of rule breaks can be written, and all rules are up to individual staff interpretation.
- Administrators will be held accountable should they utilize this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]1.2[/color] This is an English only server, you should be using it as your primary method of communication
- You may add words or brief phases in another language, as long as it’s not used to communicate with another player in the same language.

[color=#a4885c]1.3[/color] Do not communicate in-round information to other people.
- This includes discussing the current round in our Discord server, this includes even mundane comments such as “Hey I'm a chef, who wants to be a botanist?”
- Exceptions do apply if you are asking for help, as long as you keep revealed information to a minimum.
- Do not stream content from Nebulous Stories on Twitch, Youtube, or other social media sites.

[color=#a4885c]1.4[/color] No discrimination or bigotry.
- Racism, sexism, homophobia, violence, threats, hate speech, slurs, and other forms of bigotry, discrimination, and harassment will result in an appeal only ban.
- This includes denigration of other player characters through reference to their species/morphotype or by comparison to non sophonts.

[color=#a4885c]1.5[/color] Respect others' consent choices.
0 Players may use the OOC character descriptor as a method of showing consent for various mature topics, including ERP
- If someone tells you to stop doing/discussing a topic via LOOC, [color=#ff0000]stop[/color]. And take your actions/discussions to a more private location, or even off-server.

[color=#a4885c]1.6[/color] Do not ignore, intentionally disconnect from, or react with hostility in the ahelp.
- We do not tolerate any form of abuse towards our staff.
- This also includes spamming the relay with unrelated messages or admin checking.

[color=#a4885c]1.7[/color] Do not abuse exploits or bugs.
- If you discover a bug, you should instantly report it, and never intentionally use it.
- Do not use external programs like autoclickers, macros, client cheats.

[color=#a4885c]2.0 General Rules:[/color]
General rules and common practice. The "bare-minimum" expectations that you should be following.


[color=#a4885c]2.1[/color] Have in-round reason, rationale, and roleplay for your character's actions.
- Clowns, mimes, and other traditionally "prankster" roles do not get an exception, and you should not use their job as an excuse to antagonize.

[color=#a4885c]2.2[/color] Do not meta-friend or meta-grudge.
- You are allowed to have relationships with other characters based on your previous rounds (such as friends or enemies), but these cannot be used to grant or refuse items/services.

[color=#a4885c]2.3[/color] Speak and act like a believable person.
- You are playing a high-roleplay server; speak and act like a human being. You will be held to a higher standard of roleplay
- Do not use text speech such as “omg”, “idk”, “wtf”, or “lol”.
- Do not abuse emotes to bypass the inability to speak.
- Do not respond to events in a highly unbelievable manner, stick to how your character would react.

[color=#a4885c]2.4[/color] As a non antagonist, do not commit major crimes without admin approval.
- Minor crimes are allowed for non-antagonists with proper escalation and in-character reasoning.
- Cults, department independence (such as Cargonia or Atmosia), or other widely disruptive behavior is strictly forbidden for non-antagonists. Antagonists may perform such actions with in-round reason and rationale, but should ahelp it first.

[color=#a4885c]2.5[/color] Keep your damage proportional to your objectives.
- The damage that antagonists can cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way. If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to ahelp and ask an admin for clarification.
- Antagonists should aim for creative, roleplay-driven interactions, rather than simple chaos and destruction.
- Explosives and strategies with capacity for high collateral damage should not be used on or around the evacuation shuttle after it arrives at the station.

[color=#a4885c]3.0 Roleplay Guidelines:[/color]
Expectations and policies centered around roleplay.

[color=#a4885c]3.1[/color] Your character is a separate entity from you, the player.
- Your character is a distinct entity with their own motivations, beliefs, and experiences, separate from your personal views and knowledge. Your actions should come solely from in-character reasoning.

[color=#a4885c]3.2[/color] Do not intentionally prepare items "just in case".
- Do not prepare items in case a certain scenario happens. You should not expect danger or antagonists to show up, and thus should not prepare for it. Your character does not have knowledge about antagonists or their objectives.
- The alert procedure defines how areas should be locked down, based on the alert level. Do not bolt your office or maintenance airlocks without a proper reason.

[color=#a4885c]3.3[/color] Do not overcrowd departmental RP situations.
- If security is dealing with a situation, be respectful of their operations, do not needlessly intervene. You should only be stepping in if you're taking the full side of the suspect and intend to act as an accomplice.
- Do not follow a patient/involved person into a location such as the medical bay unless you have good reason to, for example you having information on their condition that you are going to give or an officer making an arrest.
- Do not barge into situations you do not belong in and force yourself into it. Treat it like a real security or medical emergency; discuss things on the sides quietly, but do not intervene.

[color=#a4885c]3.4[/color] Do not seek out to kill or detain unrelated threats.
- Crew may handle threats if they present themselves, but they should be handled by security otherwise.
- Station-wide emergencies like nuclear operatives, space dragons, or zombies, are an exception to this rule.

[color=#a4885c]3.5[/color] Follow the new life rule.
- If a player dies and is brought back by way of cloning or borging, they forget the last five minutes leading up to their death and cannot describe who or what killed them.
- Players that are revived by using a defibrillator can only recall vague details about their death, such as "Someone shot me" or "I was set ablaze" but they cannot recall details beyond that.

[color=#a4885c]3.6[/color] Stay within your job, reasonable knowledge, and abilities.
- Do not use knowledge that you have learned out-of-character while you are in-character.
- Unless your character has a past in a particular line of work, they should not know how to do jobs outside of their own.
- Do not do the jobs of other people for them, only play the role you signed up for. If you want to work a different job, ask the Head of Personnel for a job change. Exceptions can be made for if no active staff exist for a department.
- Characters may change jobs from time to time, but not from shift to shift.

[color=#a4885c]3.7[/color] Command and security are expected to be competent and lawful.
- Neither roles should be grossly incompetent at their job or in their judgment.
- You should know the Standard Operating Procedure, Space Law, Company Policy and Alert procedure, and follow it to the best of your ability.
- You should not knowingly break the law as either command or security.
