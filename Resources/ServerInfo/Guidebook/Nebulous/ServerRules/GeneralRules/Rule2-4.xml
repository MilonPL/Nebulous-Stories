  # Rule 2.4
  As a non antagonist, do not commit major crimes without admin approval.
  - Minor crimes are allowed for non-antagonists with proper escalation and in-character reasoning.
  - Cults, department independence (such as Cargonia or Atmosia), or other widely disruptive behavior is strictly forbidden for non-antagonists. Antagonists may perform such actions with in-round reason and rationale, but should ahelp it first.
