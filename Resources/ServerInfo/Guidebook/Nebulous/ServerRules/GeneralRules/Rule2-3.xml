  # Rule 2.3
  Speak and act like a believable person.
  - You are playing a high-roleplay server; speak and act like a human being. You will be held to a higher standard of roleplay
  - Do not use text speech such as “omg”, “idk”, “wtf”, or “lol”.
  - Do not abuse emotes to bypass the inability to speak.
  - Do not respond to events in a highly unbelievable manner, stick to how your character would react.
