  # Rule 2.5
  Keep your damage proportional to your objectives.
  - The damage that antagonists can cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way. If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to ahelp and ask an admin for clarification.
  - Antagonists should aim for creative, roleplay-driven interactions, rather than simple chaos and destruction.
