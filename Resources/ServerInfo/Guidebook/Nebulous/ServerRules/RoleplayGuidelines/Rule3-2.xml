  # Rule 3.2
  Do not intentionally prepare items “just in case”.
  - Do not prepare items in case a certain scenario happens. You should not expect danger or antagonists to show up, and thus should not prepare for it. Your character does not have knowledge about antagonists or their objectives.
  - The alert procedure defines how areas should be locked down, based on the alert level. Do not bolt your office or maintenance airlocks without a proper reason.
