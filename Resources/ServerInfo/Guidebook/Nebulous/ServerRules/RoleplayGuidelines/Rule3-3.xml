  # Rule 3.3
  Do not overcrowd departmental RP situations.
  - If security is dealing with a situation, be respectful of their operations, do not needlessly intervene. You should only be stepping in if you're taking the full side of the suspect and intend to act as an accomplice.
  - Do not follow a patient/involved person into a location such as the medical bay unless you have good reason to, for example you having information on their condition that you are going to give or an officer making an arrest.
  - Do not barge into situations you do not belong in and force yourself into it. Treat it like a real security or medical emergency; discuss things on the sides quietly, but do not intervene.
