  # Rule 1.3
  Do not communicate in-round information to other people.
  - This includes discussing the current round in our Discord server, this includes even mundane comments such as “Hey I'm a chef, who wants to be a botanist?”
  - Exceptions do apply if you are asking for help, as long as you keep revealed information to a minimum.
  - Do not stream content from Nebulous Stories on Twitch, Youtube, or other social media sites.
