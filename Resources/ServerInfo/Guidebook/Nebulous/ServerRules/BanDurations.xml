  # Ban Durations

  Bans can be appealed on the Nebulous Stories Discord in the appeals channel.

  ## Temporary
  Temporary bans will be lifted automatically after a certain amount of time. If they are a game ban, they will tell you how much time is remaining when you try to connect.

  ## Appeal-Only
  These bans will only be removed on a successful appeal on the Discord. Any ban which doesn't tell you when it expires and doesn't specify otherwise can be presumed to be an appeal-only ban.

  ## Voucher
  This is an indefinite ban which may only be appealed both with a successful appeal and which require a voucher of good behavior from the administrative team of a well-known or at least decently active SS13/SS14 server in order for the appeal to be considered. Voucher bans typically cannot be appealed for at least six months after being issued. Without a voucher, a player can only attempt to appeal a voucher ban once, and only if the ban was inappropriately placed.

  ## Permanent
  This is a ban that is only appealable if the ban was inappropriately placed, including if the ban should not have been permanent. If the result of the appeal is that the ban was appropriately placed, the ban may not be appealed again and will not be lifted.
